# Fuse double axis content listing
This is an example of how to achieve the "Netflix" style for listing content with a double axis scrollview using [Fuse Tools](https://fusetools.com).

![Preview](/docs/preview.gif "Preview")

## How to test
Since the example shows how to get the content from a JSON you should serve the docs/demo-content folder to 127.0.0.1:9000
You can achieve this easily standing on docs/demo-content folder path with your terminal and run either
```sh
php -S 127.0.0.1:9000
```
or
```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000
```

## About the files
The two main files are ContentDetails and ContentList, one view for the list and one for the content itself. 
It's pretty straightforward.
